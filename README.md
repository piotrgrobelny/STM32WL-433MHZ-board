# STM32WL-433MHZ-board
STM32WL developer board with RF antenna. The board is made to work with LoRa, GFSK, GMSK, BPSK in 433MHz frequency. 
STM32WLE5CCU6 with single code Cortex-M4 256KB Flash and 64KB RAM is used. The project is based on different boards like Nucleo and BB-STM32WL. Feel free to use, but i don't promise that it will work. 

## Features
- STM32WLE5CCU6 Single code 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4
